Pill Pall - Your friendly reminder to take your medication!

A user would simply have to scan their prescription label (printed and stuck on the tablets, i.e. take 1 tablet 3 times a day, etc) and our application would automatically parse this image and convert it into Google calendar reminders as well as alerted via a pill box!
